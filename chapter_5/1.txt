Academic Project Details:

AUTOMATIC RAILWAY GATE CONTROL SYSTEM  (Mini project(B.Tech))

                This project utilizes Two IR Tx/Rx. Pair is placed at either side of the gate with some distance. When train cuts first sensor light signal toggled from Green to Red; a buzzer gets activated for 2 seconds and railway gate will closed. When train cuts second sensor then a countdown timer starts and when it counts zero light signal again toggled from Red to Green ; again buzzer gets activated for 2 Seconds and gates will closed. Timing for countdown timer is set in the controller according to the speed and length of the train. Programming Language used in this project is Embedded C.

VOICE AND GESTURE CONTROLLED WHEEL CHAIR WITH SMS SERVICE DURING EMERGENCY SITUATIONS  (Main project(B.Tech))

        A voice and gesture based system has been developed to control a wheel chair using voice commands and moment of hand. And also having GSM module , by using GSM subsystem SMS service on emergency situation by accessing some gesture command. The system is divided into 4 main components: speech recognition module, gesture recognition system, GSM module and wheelchair control unit. In the speech recognition module, recognizing voice commands and the commands are given to microcontroller and it gives the required output. The gesture recognition uses a 3 axis accelerometer which senses the angle of the hand, i.e. according to the tilt of hand it gives voltages to microcontroller. The wheelchair control unit is developed using microcontroller. Programming Language used in this project is Embedded C.
